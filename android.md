Then click **Invite User**. Your account key is ready. ðŸŽ‰

</li>

<li>Your account is now ready, save the `.json` file created into a location on your build machine. Don't check it into a public version control system</li>
<li>Configure your `deploy.yaml` file's `credentialsFile` property to point at the downloaded file's path from the step above.</li>

<li>Configure your `packageName` to match the package name declared in your `\android\app\build.gradle`</li>
<li>Specify what's new in this build</li>

</ol>


*** If you are having problems
Ensure that `flutter build appbundle` is working correctly as a command at the root of your project and resolve any errors associated with that.
